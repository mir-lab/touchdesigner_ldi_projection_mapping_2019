# TouchDesigner LDI Projection Mapping 2019
Projection Mapping with TouchDesigner 

## Target Audience

If turn key tools are out of your price range or lack the flexibility and adaptability you need for your media projects this might be the workshop for you. If you are an artist/designer/engineer that's looking for ways to engage with clients in ways that are outside of the bounds of traditional playback systems this might be the workshop for you. If you've been experimenting with TouchDesigner but want some direction in how to think about incorporating it into your larger workflow or project deployment, this might be the workshop for you. This workshop is built around beginner and intermediate concepts in working with TouchDesigner in installation / performance settings - no prior experience with TouchDesigner or Python is expected from participants.

## Getting Ready

As we speed towards LDI I hope you’re finding yourself excited about taking some time to learn more about TouchDesigner! Before you arrive, however, there are a few important things to keep in mind that will make the workshop run smoothly, and ensure you can focus on getting the most out of our time together. Below you’ll find a list of required first steps / tools to bring with you, and some recommended steps to help you prepare.

**Required**

* **Bring you Laptop** – Mac or PC. Make sure you review the [System Requirements](http://derivative.ca/wiki099/index.php?title=System_Requirements) from Derivative so you know you have a machine that’s TouchDesigner ready.

* **Don’t forget your power adapter** – TouchDesigner is largely a GPU based environment. This makes for fast operations, but often means that your battery will get consumed quickly. You’ll definitely want your adapter, even if it’s a pain to lug around.

* **[Download TouchDesigner 099](https://www.derivative.ca/099/Downloads/)** – it’s very important to make sure your machine can run TouchDesigner before you get to the workshop. There are some specific graphics card requirements and making sure everything works before the first day will make sure we can get the group started right away.

* **Get your TouchDesigner 099 License** – you can [register for a Derivative account here](http://www.derivative.ca/Login/RegisterForm.asp), and that will make sure you can create a non-commercial license key. The non-commercial license is free, and we won’t need anything more than this for our workshop.

**Recommended**

* **A 3 Button mouse** – You certainly can use a track pad while you’re working, but you’ll be much happier to have an actual mouse for working in Touch.

* **Download and Install a text Editor** – I like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/), but if you’re looking for free tools it’s hard to go wrong with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
[**Join the TouchDesigner Slack Channel**](https://slackpass.io/touchdesigner) – there are lots of great folks to chat with and learn from in here.

* **Bring some Assets** – You certainly don’t have to bring any extra assets, but it’s often nice to have more than just the stock images / videos handy.

* **Business Cards** – the best resources you’ll find at LDI workshops will be the other people in the room with you. If  you’ve got some extra business cards make sure you bring a stack to share with the folks in our group.

* [**First Things To Know**](https://www.derivative.ca/wiki099/index.php?title=First_Things_to_Know_about_TouchDesigner) – We’re going to cover a good chunk of what you’ll find in these videos and transcripts, but when it comes to learning something new repetition is no bad thing. If you’ve got some time to kill on the plane or in your hotel room you might browse the wiki a little to get yourself familiar with the TouchDesigner environment.

**Be Inspired**

* Take a look at some of the projects featured on the [Derivative Blog](https://www.derivative.ca/Blog/) to see what people are making and doing with TouchDesigner.
